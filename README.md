# Hey, Sanika Here!!

This is a small effort by me to teach some of the essential things for using GitHub. I myself am not an expert, but as is the case with Open Source, every little contribution counts. I know you will be able to learn the rest of the things by exploring GitHub on your own.

## Let's Get Started!!

## Objectives

1. To Learn How to Fork a Repo
2. To Learn How to Clone a Repo in Your Local System
3. To Learn How to Create an Issue
4. To Learn How to Commit Changes in the Codebase
5. To Learn How to Create a Pull Request

## Prerequisites

1. Must have a laptop with an active internet connection.
2. Must have Git installed. If not, I suggest you watch a video on YouTube for installing Git. [Recommended video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON5GAXubt_4) [Recommended Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkbK31dMNfM).
3. Must have a GitHub Account.
4. And that's it!!

## Steps to Be Followed

1. Open this repo from the link provided to you or from my profile.
2. As you see my name and then the name of the repo, it means that this project is mine (in simple language).
3. Since this project is mine, you cannot make changes in it. For this, you have to Fork and Clone this project in your system.
4. There is a "Fork" option on the top right side of the page. Click on that. (Your project is Forked).
5. Then you will see a green "Code" button. Click on that, and you will see a link. This link is used to clone our project in your local system with the help of Git Bash.
6. I am providing the link here. Just copy the statement in brackets and paste it in Git Bash. Sometimes Ctrl + V doesn't work there, so you can use the right-click of the mouse.
7. (git clone https://github.com/Sanika2103/good-first-issue.git) This will clone your repo, and when you open your GitHub, you will see this repo with your name. It means that it's your copy of the code, and you can make changes in it.
8. Then you have to open the index.html file.
9. From this file, you don't need to understand any code. It's just an example of the codebase.
10. Click the "Edit" (pencil) option.
11. Scroll down, and you will get the code below.
